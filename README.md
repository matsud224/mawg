# mAWG

This mini AWG `mAWG` generates waveform by reading data from Wave Pattern Storage according to Chunk Storage entries.

## Overview

![overview](figures/overview.png)

This module starts to run when `kick` is asserted. During the module runs, `busy` is asserted. This module generates waves according to specified parameters, however, users can stop the module anytime by asserting `force_stop`. When and only when this module generates valid wave, `wave_out` is asserted.

### Definition of `Wave`

Wave is generated by the combination of multiple chunks defined by the parameters of the Chunk Storage entry.
Each Chunk Storage entry contains `chunk_length`, `chunk_offset`, and `chunk_repetition`.
The `chunk_offset` and `chunk_length` specify the start address and length of `Wave Pattern Storage` to read for each chunk.
The `chunk_repetition` gives the repetitions of the chunk.
The number of entries read from Chunk Storage is given by `ctrl_length`,
and `repetition` gives the number of repetitions of reading the sequence of chunks.
